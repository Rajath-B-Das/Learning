Probability Theory:

P(X) = # of possibilities for event X/ Total # of possibilities

The Monty Hall problem:
Q. Three doors - behind one of them is a car, and the other three are empty. Contestant has to pick a door, then an unpicked empty door is shown and the contestant is asked if he wants to switch.
Is switching a better option?

Soln. Yes, the chance of picking a goat is higher initially, which means 2/3 times you are likely to pick a goat. Hence your initial pick might be a goat (most probably)

Theoretical vs experimental probability

An experiment indicates that after flipping a coin for 10 times, the results was 8 heads with 2 twos, here the experimental prob is 0.8, but theoretically would have equal chances 0.5. 
As the number of trials increases, experimental prob moves towards theoretical prob


---------------------------------
Rule:
P(A or B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A and B)

If these are mutually exclusive events, P(A and B becomes 0)

Compound events the sample space has events dependent on each other, Getting a Small coffee from (Coffee, Cappuccino) and (S, M, L)

Independent events, eg. having two heads when a coin is flipped twice. The probability of event 2 doesn't depend on even 1


--------------------------------------
Multiplication rule for Independent events

P(10 heads in a row) = P(head)^# rimes in a row. Since the events are independent

Example 1 : Defective chips

A manufacturer of processing chips knows that 2% percent of its chips are defective in some way.
Suppose an inspector randomly selects 4 chips for an inspection.
Assuming the chips are independent, what is the probability that at least one of the selected chips is defective?
Lets break this problem up into smaller pieces to understand the strategy behind solving it.

EXAMPLE 1: PROBLEM B
Find the probability that all 4 chips are NOT defective.
0.98^4=0.922

EXAMPLE 1: PROBLEM C
Find the probability that at least one of the selected chips is defective.
P(at least one defective)
​	  
=1−P(all 4 not defective)
=1−(0.98) 
4
 
≈1−0.922
≈0.078
​	 


Generalizing the strategy

In general, we can use these strategies:
P(at least 1 success)=1-P(all failures)

or similarly,
P(at least 1 failure)=1-P(all successes)

----------------------------------------

Multiplication rule for dependent events

Eg. Bag contains 5 marbles, 3 of them are green and 2 are red
Odds of picking two greens = P(green in first pick)*P(green in second pick, with first one as green)
=3/5 * 2/4 = 0.3


The general multiplication rule

For any two events, we can say that
P(a and b) = P(a) * p(b|a)
This formula says that we can multiply the probabilities of two events, but we need to take the first event into account when considering the probability of the second event.
If the events are independent, one happening doesn't impact the probability of the other, and in that case,
p(b|a) = p(b)



-----------------------------
Bayes Theorem:

P(a|b) = p(b|a)*p(a)/p(b)

Independent events = p(b|a)=p(b)

-----------------------
Eg.

Drug test: 
false positive rate=2%
false negative rate=1%

5% of people use illegal drugs, P(drugs)=5%

probability of spomeone actually using drugs provided they are tested positive = p(drugs | +ve)

p(drugs | +ve) = p(+ve | drugs)*p(drugs)/p(+ve)

=0.98*0.05/(0.98*0.05 + 0.95*0.02) = 72%
