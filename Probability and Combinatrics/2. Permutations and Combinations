Permutation:
Number of ways n things can be arranged taking 3 at a time
n!/(n-r)!


-------------------------------------------

0! = ?

n! = n*n-1*n-2*........1

nPr = n!/(n-r)!
nPn = n! = n!/(n-n)! = n!/0!

This implies 0!=1

------------------------------------
Combination:
Number of ways that r things can be chosen from n things

nCr = nPr/r!

-------------------------------------
Probability using combinations:

Eg. Probability of getting exactly 3 heads from 8 flips


Total number of possibilities = 2^8 = X

How many of these possibilities have 3 heads in them?
8C3 = 8!/[(8-3)! * 3!] = Y

p(3 Heads/8 Flips) = Y/X

-----------------------------------------------
Eg 2.

probability of picking 4 ones in a card game with 36 unique cards (1 to 9, 4 suits). Hand consists of 9 cards

Total number of ways to choose 9 cards from 36 = 36C9

# of ways to get 4 ones in a 9 card hand = possible combinations from other cards = 32C5

Probability = 32C5/36C9


-----------------------------------------------
Eg 3.

probability of getting 2 heads from 4 flips


Total combinations = 2^4, since these are independent events

Combinations for 2 heads = 4C2 = 4*3/(2*1) = 6

p(2/4) = 6/16

--------------------------------------------------
Eg 3.

probability of getting 3 heads from 5 flips


Total combinations = 2^5, since these are independent events

Combinations for 3 heads = 5C3 = 5*4*3/(3*2*1) = 10

p(2/4) = 10/32 = 5/16

---------------------------------------------
Eg 4.

Probability of getting 3,5,16, 49 as the lottery draw number, if number ranges from 1 to 60

How many such combinations are possible?
60C4 = Number of ways choosing 4 numbers

Number of ways choosing the specific combination = 1

probability of these 4 being the winning combination=1/60C4
