Regression:

1. Linear Regression - 

Residual sum of squares (RSS) = Sum(actual-predicted)^2

Best fit implies least RSS,

A 3D plot of w0 on x and w1 on y and RSS on z, can be plotted to get w0 and w1 values for least RSS

Maxima or minima of the curve is point a derivative = 0
 To identify whether curve is concave or convex, 2nd derivative can be used

Another way to identify the maxima/minima
 Hill climbing/Hill Descent algos can be used
 
 
RSS = Sum[i to N](y-[w0+w1xi)
So, derivate of RSS w.r.t w0 and w1 needs to be identified
