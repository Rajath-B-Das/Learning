z-score:
It is the number of SD deviations the value is from the mean
z-score = (1/SD)*(x-mean)

Eg: Mean = 5, SD = 1
Find the z-score of 3
=(3-5)/1 = -2

Eg: Student X wants to know which exam he performed better:
Math: 
   mean = 40
   SD = 5
   score = 50

Science:
   mean = 30
   SD=10
   score = 40
   
z(math) = 2
z(science) = 1

Hence, he has performed better in math relatively

Effect of data shift on central tendency and spread

Mean of sample S is 10 and SD is 2

Adding 2 to each data point
 Mean_new = Mean_old+2
 SD_new = SD_old
 
Multiplying 2 to each data point
 Mean_new = Mean_old*2
 SD_new = SD_old*2

Density Curves:
 Relative frequencies plotted for a continuous x

Some Properties of a Density Curve:
 Mean, Median, Skew
 
Mean<Median - left skewed
Mean>Median - Right skewed
