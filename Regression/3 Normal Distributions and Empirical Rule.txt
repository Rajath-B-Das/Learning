Empirical rule:
 The normal distribution defined by mean(mu) and SD(sigma)
 68%   of the area is covered within mu(+/-) 1 SD
 95%   of the area is covered within mu(+/-) 2 SD
 99.7% of the area is covered within mu(+/-) 3 SD
There is a 99.7% chance of finding the result within +/- 3SD

--------------------
Standard Normal Distribution:
Mean=0 and SD = 1

Note: 
 z-score just indicates the number of SD the value is away from the mean
 It is not specific to Normal distribution
