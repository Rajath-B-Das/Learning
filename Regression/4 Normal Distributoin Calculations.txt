Q1.
Heights of students are normally distributed
 Mean = 150cm
 SD = 20cm
What is the proportion of students with height < 164cm

Soln.
Estimate the z-score
 z = 164-150/20
Lookup this value in the z table to estimate the proportion

-----------------------------
Finding z-score for a percentile:

z-score has to be estimated given the percentage value required
Then mean +/- z*SD will be the value for that percentage

p(x) = height of the curve at x = 1/(sqrt(2*pi*sigma^2*e^(z^2))
