----------------------------
Scatterplots are leveraged to analyze bi-variate data
 Linearity, Strength and direction of relationship between the variables
 
Linearity: Linear/Non-Linear
Strength: Strong/Weak
Direction: Positive/negative

--------------------------
Correlation

We often see patterns or relationships in scatterplots.
 When the y variable tends to increase as the x variable increases, we say there is a positive correlation between the variables.
 When the y variable tends to decrease as the x variable increases, we say there is a negative correlation between the variables.
 
--------------------------
Correlation Coefficient

r = 1/(n-1)*Sum(Zxi*Zyi)

Zxi = (xi-mean_x)/SD_x
Zyi = (yi-mean_y)/SD_y

If sample is considered, take unbiased estimate of SD

 Correlation Co-efficient range from -1 to a +1

-------------------------
Introduction to trend lines:

A trend line is the best fit line or the linear fit with least residuals
 Residual = Actual - Predicted
 Predicted is considered from the fitted line
 So, Sum(residual_n^2) is considered
    Square to eliminate the cancellation of positive and negative deviations
	and square to influence higher effect due to larger deviations

--------------------------
Calculating the equation of trend line:

line equation = y_hat = mx+b
Slope m = r*(SD_y/SD_x)

Once m is identified, b can be estimated by using points which lie on the line
Now, mean_x and mean_y will always lie on the line

-------------------------
Assessing the fit of a trend line:

Residual plot - 
 Plot of residuals (i.e, actual - predicted) w.r.t x
 The residuals if closer to 0, indicates good fit
 If the residuals, show some trend, then its a bad fit
 
R-squared - 
 square of correlation co-efficient
 Measures the proprtion of variability explained by the trend line
 
 Suppose, a average line (y_mean) is fit, and the total squared residuals = X (deviation from mean)
 after the fit, the total squared residuals = Y
 then r_squared = 1-(Y/X)
 

RMSD (Standard deviation of residuals or Root mean square error)
 Indicates the SD in residuals
 lower the value (i.e, lower the deviation in residuals), better the fit
